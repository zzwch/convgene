# Valuable Gene set

- Transcription Factor
  - [AnimalTFDB (v3.0)](http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/AnimalTFDB/)
    - AnimalTFDB is a comprehensive database including classification and annotation of genome-wide transcription factors (TFs), and transcription cofactors in 97 animal genomes. The TFs are further classified into 73 families based on their DNA-binding domain (DBD) and cofactors are classified into 83 families and 6 categories.

  - [PanglaoDB](https://panglaodb.se)  (metadata on [Github](https://github.com/oscar-franzen/PanglaoDB))  IT IS SO GREAT!

    - [Cell type gene expression markers](https://panglaodb.se/markers.html)

      > This is a list of gene expression markers are used to define cell types. Green rows indicate canonical markers (classical markers used to define the cell type).
      >
      > Summary: 8286 associations (178 cell types, 4679 gene symbols, 29 tissues); Last updated: 27/03/2020 10:44:00 CET

    - [Ubiquitousness index](https://panglaodb.se/ui.html)

      > Ubiquitousness Index (0-1). 0 indicates the gene is not expressed in any cell cluster and 1 (maximum) indicates that the gene is expressed in all cell clusters. Can be useful for spotting genes that are likely to be housekeeping genes.

    - [Publications in the scientific literature](https://panglaodb.se/papers.html) (Yes, it's not markers ðŸ˜‚)

      >
      > This list contains 3030 papers covering various topics of single cell sequencing. It is compiled by searching for keywords in abstracts and titles using data from ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/updatefiles/ and ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/baseline/. It is automatically updated daily. Rows in blue indicate papers in "high impact" journals.
