- Transcription Factor
  - [AnimalTFDB (v3.0)](http://bioinfo.life.hust.edu.cn/AnimalTFDB/)
    - AnimalTFDB is a comprehensive database including classification and annotation of genome-wide transcription factors (TFs), and transcription cofactors in 97 animal genomes. The TFs are further classified into 73 families based on their DNA-binding domain (DBD) and cofactors are classified into 83 families and 6 categories.
